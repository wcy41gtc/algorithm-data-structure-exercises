### Reasoning Behind Code Decisions

The code utilizes recursion to traverse the directory structure, which is essential because the depth of subdirectories can be unlimited. The base case for the recursion is when the path is a file; the function checks if the file has the desired suffix and returns it in a list if it does. If the path is a directory, the code initializes an empty list to store paths and iterates over each file and subdirectory within the directory. For each item, the function calls itself recursively with the updated path. This design ensures that all files and subdirectories are explored, and any file matching the suffix is collected.

### Time and Space Efficiency

In terms of time efficiency, the solution has a time complexity of O(n*m), where 'n' is the number of files and directories in the directory tree, and 'm' is the average length of the file names. This complexity arises because each file and directory needs to be checked once. Space efficiency is O(n), where 'n' is the number of files that match the suffix, due to the list storing these file paths. Additionally, the recursive call stack will consume memory proportional to the maximum depth of the directory tree, which can affect space usage for deeply nested structures.
