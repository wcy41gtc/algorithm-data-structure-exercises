### Reasoning Behind Decisions

In the provided Huffman coding algorithm, the use of a priority queue (heap) is crucial for efficiently building the Huffman tree. The `heapq` module is utilized to maintain a min-heap, which allows for the extraction of the two nodes with the lowest frequencies in O(log n) time. This is essential for the merging process during tree construction. The `defaultdict` from the `collections` module is employed to count character frequencies in linear time, ensuring that the frequency table is built efficiently. The `HuffmanNode` class is designed to store each character and its frequency, as well as pointers to left and right child nodes, which are necessary for constructing and traversing the tree. The comparison operator (`__lt__`) is overridden to facilitate the heap operations based on node frequencies.

### Time Efficiency and Space Efficiency

The time complexity of building the Huffman tree is O(n log n), where n is the number of unique characters in the input data. This is because inserting all characters into the heap takes O(n log n) time, and extracting the two smallest nodes and merging them takes O(log n) time, which is repeated until the heap contains only one node. The time complexity for encoding and decoding is O(m), where m is the length of the input data, as each character is processed once. The space complexity is primarily determined by the size of the frequency table and the Huffman tree. The frequency table requires O(n) space, where n is the number of unique characters. The tree itself also takes O(n) space, as each character is represented by a node. Additionally, the encoded output may be larger than the input in cases where the characters have high frequencies and shorter codes, but this is offset by the compression achieved for characters with longer codes.
