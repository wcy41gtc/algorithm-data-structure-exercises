### Reasoning Behind the Decisions

The binary search algorithm is chosen for this problem because it efficiently narrows down the range of potential square roots by halving the search space with each iteration, leading to a logarithmic time complexity. Initially, the search range is set from 0 to the given integer, as the square root of a non-negative integer \( n \) lies between these bounds. By calculating the midpoint of this range and squaring it, we can compare the result to \( n \). If the squared value equals \( n \), we have found the exact square root. If it is less than \( n \), the true square root must be higher, so we adjust the start of the range to `mid + 1` and store the midpoint as a potential floor value. Conversely, if the squared value is greater than \( n \), we adjust the end of the range to `mid - 1` to search for smaller values. This approach ensures that the algorithm converges to the floor value of the square root efficiently.

### Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is \( O(\log n) \). This is because the binary search method splits the search range in half with each iteration, reducing the number of elements to be checked by a factor of two each time. Thus, the number of iterations required to converge to the solution is logarithmic in relation to the input size. The space complexity is \( O(1) \), as the algorithm uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input size. The variables used for the start, end, midpoint, and result do not scale with the size of the input, ensuring that the space requirement remains minimal and constant. This makes the algorithm both time-efficient and space-efficient for finding the floor value of the square root of a given integer.
