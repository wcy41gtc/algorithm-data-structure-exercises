### Reasoning Behind the Decisions

The function `get_min_max` is designed to find the minimum and maximum values in a list of unsorted integers with a single traversal, ensuring an O(n) time complexity. The reasoning behind this approach starts with the initialization of both the minimum (`min_val`) and maximum (`max_val`) values to the first element of the list. This is because, with only one element, it is both the smallest and largest value. The function then iterates through the list starting from the second element. For each element, it checks if the element is smaller than the current minimum or larger than the current maximum, updating `min_val` and `max_val` accordingly. This approach guarantees that we consider every element exactly once, ensuring that we correctly identify the smallest and largest values without needing any additional passes through the list.

### Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of the `get_min_max` function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the function makes a single pass through the list, examining each element exactly once. There are no nested loops or additional passes, so the time complexity remains linear with respect to the number of elements in the input list. The space complexity of the function is O(1), which is constant space complexity. This is because the function uses a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size. The variables `min_val` and `max_val` are the only additional storage used, and these do not scale with the input size. Therefore, the function efficiently finds the minimum and maximum values using minimal additional memory.
