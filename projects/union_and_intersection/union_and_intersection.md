### Reasoning Behind Decisions

In the implementation of the union and intersection functions, sets were chosen as the primary data structure for their efficient handling of unique elements and membership tests. By leveraging sets, we can easily ensure that each element appears only once in the result, which is crucial for both union and intersection operations. Additionally, sorting the elements before appending them to the resulting linked list ensures that the final output is sorted in ascending order. This approach maintains the simplicity and readability of the code while taking advantage of the inherent properties of sets to handle duplicates and membership efficiently.

### Time and Space Efficiency

The time complexity of the solution is primarily driven by the need to traverse each linked list and the subsequent sorting of elements. Specifically, the time complexity is O(n log n), where n is the total number of elements in both linked lists, due to the sorting step. The traversal of the linked lists and the insertion of elements into the set have a linear time complexity, O(n). The space complexity is O(n) as well, since we use sets to store the elements of the linked lists and an additional list to store the sorted elements before creating the new linked list. This ensures that our approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient for typical use cases.
