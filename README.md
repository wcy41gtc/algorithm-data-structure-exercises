## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of algorithm and data structure exercises that are essential for anyone looking to improve their problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews. Each exercise is designed to help you understand the fundamental concepts and apply them to solve real-world problems.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wcy41gtc/algorithm-data-structure-exercises.git
```

Navigate to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd algorithms-data-structures-exercises
```

Each exercise is contained within its respective folder, along with a README file explaining the problem statement and any additional information you might need to solve the exercise.

## Folder Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

```

└── README.md
```

Each folder contains exercises related to a specific data structure or algorithm. Inside each exercise folder, you will find:

- `README.md`: Detailed problem statement and instructions.
- `solution.py`: Placeholder for your solution (in Python).
- `test.py`: Test cases to verify your solution.

## Exercises

### Array

Practice problems related to arrays, such as finding the maximum subarray, rotating an array, and more.

### Linked List

Exercises on linked lists, including reversing a linked list, detecting cycles, and merging two sorted linked lists.

### Stack

Problems involving stack operations like evaluating expressions, checking for balanced parentheses, and implementing a stack using queues.

### Queue

Queue-related exercises such as implementing a circular queue, using two stacks to create a queue, and solving the "Josephus problem".

### Tree

Exercises on binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and more. Problems include traversals, finding the height of a tree, and converting a tree to a doubly linked list.

### Graph

Graph-related problems including depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), detecting cycles, and finding the shortest path.

### Hash Map

Exercises involving hash maps, such as implementing a hash map, designing an LRU cache, and solving problems like two-sum and group anagrams.

### Sorting Algorithms

Practice implementing various sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, bubblesort, and understanding their time complexities.

### Search Algorithms

Exercises on searching algorithms, including binary search, linear search, and searching in a rotated sorted array.

### Projects

Small standalone projects for real world applications.
