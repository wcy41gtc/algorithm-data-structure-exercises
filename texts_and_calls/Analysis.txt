# TASK 0
# The time complexity of this code is O(1) because the code is only accessing the first and last elements of the texts and calls lists.

# TASK 1
# The time complexity of this code is O(2n) because the code is iterating through all the elements in the texts and calls lists.

# TASK 2
# The time complexity of this code is O(n+m) because the code is iterating through all the elements in the calls list, then iterating m elements in phone_time dictionary.

# TASK 3
# The time complexity of this code is O(2n+nlog(n)) because the code iterates calls list twice and sorts the codes list.

# TASK 4
# The time complexity of this code is O(2n+m) because the code iterates through all elements in calls twice and all elements in texts once.
